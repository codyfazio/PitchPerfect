# PitchPerfect

This is first project required for completion of Udacity's iOS Nanodegree. It allows the user to make a recording, and then apply effects to the audio and play it back. 

The user is first presented with a button to begin recording there voice. Once finished, they are presented with option to rerecord or use the recording. Once they have chosen a recording they are happy with, they can then apply one of 5 effects. They can: slow the recording, speed up the recording, apply a Darth Vader modulation, apply a chipmunk modulation, or apply a mystery modulation. Selecting the effect applies it to the recording and begins playback. 

If there is anything missing from this document you'd like to see, or if there is anything I can do to improve this project please let me know!
